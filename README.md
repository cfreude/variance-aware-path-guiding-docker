##  Variance-Aware Path Guiding - Docker

This fork adds changes and files to run VAPG in a docker container.

```
Note: Currently the Python API is disabled via "SConscript.configure".
```

We use a dockerfile with **docker compose** to build an image (based on **ubuntu 18.04**) which includes all necessary libraries and ENV variables.
Since we only include **Mitsuba's** source code by mounting the root folder of this repository as a **docker volume** into the folder "/code" inside the container, we can not compile **Mitsuba** already while building the **docker image**, but need to do it manually inside the running **docker container**.
A advantage of mounting the repo as a volume it, that all files and changes 

#### Docker Setup
1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and start it.
2. Open a terminal.
3. Change to the root folder of this repository.
4. Execute ```docker compose -f ./docker/docker-compose.yml up --build -d```

Now the container is up and running, kept alive by the last CMD (```tail -F anything```) of the Dockerfile.
Next we need to build Mitsuba inside the container.
For this one can use e.g. ```docker exec``` or ```docker attach```.

#### Build and Run

1. Open a terminal.
2. Execute ```docker exec -it vapg-mitsuba bash``` to open an interactive shell inside the docker container.
3. Execute ```cd mitsuba/ && ./build.sh``` to build Mitsuba.
4. Execute ```./dist/mitsuba``` to test if Mitsuba runs.

#### Visual Studio Code

It is possible to attach Visual Studio Code directly to the running container. 

1. Install and open [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Install the [Visual Studio Code Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) Extension.
3. Press **Ctrl+Shift+P** and type or choose ```Dev Containers: Attach to Running Container...```.
4. Select ```/mitsuba``` container to open a new attached VS Code Editor Window.

## Variance-Aware Path Guiding

![Teaser Figure](resources/teaser.png)

This repository contains the authors' implementation of the ["Variance-Aware Path Guiding"](https://graphics.cg.uni-saarland.de/publications/rath-2020-siggraph-guiding.html) guiding target function as demonstrated in ["Practical Path Guiding for Efficient Light-Transport Simulation" [MÃ¼ller et al. 2017]](https://tom94.net).

## Selecting the guiding distribution

In addition to the parameters of the [original implementation](https://github.com/Tom94/practical-path-guiding), we add the following parameters that allow switching between the previous guiding target function and our proposed target functions.
These can be set in the Mitsuba GUI or in the scene files by using their property name (denoted by the `monospace text` in brackets).

### Guiding Distribution (`distribution`)
The guiding distribution that should be approximated.
The following values are valid:
* `radiance`: Guiding distribution used by previous works.
* `simple`: Approximates parts of the integrand.  
  Robust for very short renders (< 10 seconds), but worse than `full` for longer renders
* `full`: Approximates the full integrand.  
  Recommended for longer renders (> 10 seconds), otherwise use `simple`

Default = `radiance` (for reproducibility)  
Recommended = `full` (as evaluated in our paper)

### DI strategy (`diStrategy`)
The strategy for direct illumination guiding.
The following values are valid:
* `no`: Do not guide towards direct illumination [Mueller et al. 2017].
* `unweighted`: Guide direct illumination, ignoring MIS [Mueller et al. 2017, kickstart].
* `weighted`: Guide direct illumination weighted by MIS weights.

Default = `no` (for reproducibility)  
Recommended = `no` (for robustness, as evaluated in our paper)

## Compilation

### Mitsuba

To compile the Mitsuba code, please follow the instructions from the [Mitsuba documentation](http://mitsuba-renderer.org/docs.html) (sections 4.1.1 through 4.6). Since our new code uses C++11 features, a slightly more recent compiler and dependencies than reported in the mitsuba documentation may be required. We only support compiling mitsuba with the [scons](https://www.scons.org) build system.

We tested our Mitsuba code on
- Windows (Visual Studio 2013 Win64, custom dependencies via `git clone https://github.com/Tom94/mitsuba-dependencies-windows mitsuba/dependencies`)
- macOS (High Sierra / Mojave, custom dependencies via `git clone https://github.com/Tom94/mitsuba-dependencies-macOS mitsuba/dependencies`)
- Linux (GCC 6.3.1)

### Visualization Tool

The visualization tool, found in the *visualizer* subfolder, uses the [CMake](https://cmake.org/) build system. Simply invoke the CMake generator on the *visualizer* subfolder to generate Visual Studio project files on Windows, and a Makefile on Linux / OS X.

The visualization tool was tested on
- Windows (Visual Studio 2013-2017 Win64)
- macOS (High Sierra)
- Linux (GCC 6.3.1)
